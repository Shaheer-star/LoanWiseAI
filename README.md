# 💰 LoanWiseAI – Machine Learning Based Loan Approval Prediction System

Welcome to **LoanWiseAI**, a Machine Learning-based system that predicts whether a loan application should be approved or not based on user data. This project combines the power of **Data Science**, **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, and **ML algorithms** to assist financial institutions in smarter, data-driven decision-making.

## 🚀 Project Overview

LoanWiseAI is designed to predict loan approval using a variety of applicant features such as:
- Gender
- Marital Status
- Education
- Employment
- Credit History
- Income & Loan Amount
- Property Area
